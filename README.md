<h2>What Is PQQ Disodium Powder?</h2>
<p>Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a small molecule that acts as a potent antioxidant. In its disodium salt form, it’s water‑soluble and easy to dose. PQQ supports mitochondrial biogenesis, meaning it helps your cells make more of the tiny power plants that produce energy. It also helps protect neurons, which can improve mental clarity and mood.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<p>To rank Swisschems PQQ Disodium Powder, I followed a simple but thorough protocol:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purity check:</strong> Verified batch COA on Swisschems website.</li>
  <li><strong>Dosage:</strong> I used 10 mg per day, split into two 5 mg servings.</li>
  <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Each test phase lasted three weeks, with one week off in between.</li>
  <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> Logged daily energy, focus, recovery from workouts, and sleep quality.</li>
  <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> Benchmarked against baseline (no PQQ) and another antioxidant (CoQ10).</li>
</ul>
<p>I also collected feedback from five friends who used it alongside their bulking or cutting cycles. Their combined experiences helped me fine‑tune the ranking.</p>

<h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Within four days, I noticed steadier energy. No midday slump.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Tasks felt easier to start. My mind stayed on track during long work sessions.</li>
  <li><strong>Workout Recovery:</strong> Muscle soreness dropped by about 20%. I felt less stiff the day after heavy lifting.</li>
  <li><strong>Sleep Quality:</strong> I fell asleep faster and woke up feeling refreshed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I stacked PQQ with a low-dose creatine cycle during my bulking phase. It complemented creatine’s cell hydration and gave me clearer focus in the gym.</p>

  <strong>Cutting:</strong> Maintains mental clarity when calories are lower.<br>
